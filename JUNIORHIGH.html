	<p id="p2"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My highschool starts when I was in 7th grade. I was very excited that time becuase I know that I'll be meeting a lot of new people and at the same time nervous because I know that the battle starts here. My entire year as a grade 7 student was not that easy, I was able to join a lot of contests in able to have good grades. I was trained together with my classmates to join contests like Jingles, Journalism, Drum and Lyre and even in Drama. I enjoyed doing it because I love doing it, joining such contests made me satisfy myself. I was able to meet new firends and learn new things. Being active in school mame me an honor student when I was in 7th grade. I have maintained my rank as an honor student until grade 10, I was beyond happy and bless that time because my hardworks were all paid off. I recieved a lot of awards, and praises from my teachers, family and friends. God is indeed good to us, I have experienced a lot of challenges throughout my high school journey but I will not be able to move forward if I won't face it
