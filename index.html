		<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
		<br><hr>
		<p id="p4"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I grew up as a jolly and adventurous kid. I remember before, I love going outside and playing under the heat of the sun and going home very sweaty and dirty. Remiscing those days makes me want to go back before, because back then I am genuinely happy, not like now. I grew up in Surigao City and my childhood there was very memorable, I met a lot of friends from my new school. While growing up, I discovered some of my talents. I learned how to play lyre at the age of 8, how to play guitar at the age of 12, how to drum at the age of 15, and also piano when I was grade 10. I also discovered my favorite hobby which is taking pictures and doing cartooning, I joined the Campus Journalism since I was on elementary up until I graduated in junior high. It was one of the most memorable contest that I joined way back then. I also remember back when I was still nursery I already love to cook, and I started to cook when I was in grade 4, at the early age I already tought my self doing the household chores.</p><br>

		<p id="p4"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I will be given a chance to go back to my old self, I would definitely go back without hesitations. I want to live like a child who's just playing without thinking about what might happen tomorrow. I must say that I grew as a brave woman who's not dependent to anyone and can handle herself alone. I love me.<3 </p>
